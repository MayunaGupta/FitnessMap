## Exploratory Data Analysis Questions

### 1. Distribution Analysis
- What is the overall distribution of correlation coefficients?
- Are correlations normally distributed?
- What are the ranges of correlation values?
- What proportion of correlations are positive vs negative?

### 2. Network Properties
- Which genes have the most correlations with other genes?
- Are there distinct clusters of highly correlated genes?
- What is the degree distribution of the gene correlation network?
- Are there hub genes that correlate strongly with many others?

### 3. Functional Analysis
- Are genes with similar functions more likely to be correlated?
- How do correlations differ between:
  * Essential vs non-essential genes
  * Different functional categories (metabolism, regulation, etc.)
  * Conserved vs non-conserved correlations

### 4. Pathway Analysis
- Do genes in the same metabolic pathway show stronger correlations?
- Are there unexpected correlations between different pathways?
- How do regulatory genes correlate with their target genes?

### 5. Condition-Specific Patterns
- Looking at the fitness data (specific_phenotypes_Keio.txt):
  * Which conditions show the strongest gene-gene correlations?
  * Are there condition-specific correlation patterns?
  * How do stress responses affect gene correlations?

### 6. Statistical Properties
- What is the significance threshold for correlations?
- How many correlations are statistically significant?
- What is the false discovery rate?
- Are there any systematic biases in the correlation patterns?

### 7. Comparative Analysis
- How do conserved correlations differ from non-conserved ones?
- Are there any evolutionary patterns in the correlations?
- Do essential genes show different correlation patterns?

### 8. Structural Analysis
- Is there a relationship between gene proximity on the chromosome and correlation strength?
- Do operons show distinct correlation patterns?
- How do regulatory elements affect correlation patterns?

### 9. Biological Validation
- Do known genetic interactions correspond to strong correlations?
- Can we validate correlations against known biological pathways?
- Are there novel correlations that suggest unknown interactions?

### 10. Technical Quality Assessment
- Are there any systematic biases in the data?
- How complete is the correlation network?
- Are there genes with missing or unreliable data?

## Data Files
- `cofit_organism_Keio.txt`: Contains pre-calculated Pearson correlations between gene pairs
- `specific_phenotypes_Keio.txt`: Contains fitness data across different conditions
- Additional data files to be documented...

## Analysis Steps
1. Load and clean the data
2. Calculate basic statistics
3. Create visualizations for distributions and patterns
4. Cross-reference with other available data sources
